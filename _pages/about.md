# Hello, I'm Iosif Pintirishis 👋

I am a passionate statistician with a strong foundation in **mathematics**, **statistics**, and **data science**. 

- 🎓 **Education**:  
  - **BSc in Mathematics and Statistics** - University of Cyprus
  - **MSc in Data Science** - University of Cyprus
  - **PhD in Statistics** - Bocconi University (current)

- 💼 **Experience**:  
  Risk Consultant at **KPMG Cyprus**, where I applied advanced analytics and statistical models to help businesses manage risks and make data-driven decisions.

- 📚 **Research Interests**:
  I am deeply interested in the theoretical and practical aspects of **Bayesian statistics**, **nonparametric methods**, and **network analysis**.
My Master’s research project focused on applying **Bayesian modeling** to **sparse and power-law graphs** in **financial networks**. It involves analyzing a **real-world U.S. equities network**. Using a Bayesian model approach, we identify **overlapping communities of stocks** that exhibit similar behavior, uncovering **co-movement patterns** and **diversification opportunities**.
<!--
  This research demonstrates the power of **Bayesian methods** in understanding market structures and could inform **portfolio construction strategies**.
