Hello, I'm Iosif Pintirishis

I am a passionate statistician with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and data science. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Statistics at Bocconi University, following an MSc in Data Science and a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Cyprus. Alongside my academic journey, I gained professional experience as a Risk Consultant at KPMG Cyprus, where I applied advanced analytics and statistical models to support businesses in managing risks and making data-driven decisions. I am deeply interested in the theoretical and practical aspects of Bayesian statistics, nonparametric methods, machine learning and network analysis.
